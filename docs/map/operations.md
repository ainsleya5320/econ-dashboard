# Scripts and automation

Back to the [master map](../../CLAUDE.md).

## Projects
- [package.json](../../package.json): npm scripts (dev, build, preview) and dependencies (React, Recharts, Plotly, Anthropic SDK, xlsx)
- [scripts/refresh-damodaran.mjs](../../scripts/refresh-damodaran.mjs): rebuilds src/lib/damodaran.json from Damodaran's yearly spreadsheets
- [scripts/special-digest.mjs](../../scripts/special-digest.mjs): builds and scores the special-situations feed, emails new ideas through Resend
- [tests/](../../tests): node:test unit tests for local market, metro, options, property and stock-research code

## State
- [state/](../../state): digest memory, what has been sent (gitignored; kept in the Actions cache)
- [special-digest-preview.html](../../special-digest-preview.html): `--dry-run` output (gitignored)
- [.env.example](../../.env.example): the key names to copy into `.env`

## Skills
- `npm install`: required before anything else
- `npm run dev`: the app and its API on port 5180
- `node --test tests/*.test.js`: run the unit tests (after npm install; they import xlsx)
- `node scripts/refresh-damodaran.mjs`: once a year, in January
- `node scripts/special-digest.mjs --dry-run`: build and score the digest without sending

## Memory
- [README.md](../../README.md): quick start and data sources
- The header comment of scripts/special-digest.mjs lists its environment variables

## Routines
- [.github/workflows/special-digest.yml](../../.github/workflows/special-digest.yml): weekdays 14:30 UTC, runs the digest (secrets FMP_KEY, RESEND_API_KEY, DIGEST_TO_EMAIL); upstream repo only; never commits

## Not here
- The scoring the digest uses: [server data modules](server.md) (server/specialScore.js)
- The SFC rebuild command: [SFC model](sfc.md)
- The archive the digest caches: [data snapshots](data.md)
